## Problem 
The Ukrainian banking system is constantly facing challenges and problems that need to be analyzed and investigated in more detail. In the conditions of martial law, an effective process of assessing the reliability of commercial banks becomes critical importance for forecasting the functioning of the national banking system. system. An analysis of the banking system will help identify weaknesses in the the national economy and understand how the war has affected the reliability of commercial banks. In the context of economic instability, bank reliability becomes an important issue that requires attention and research. The study of bank reliability will help to identify problematic aspects of the industry and understand what measures should be taken to ensure a stable economy. to be taken to ensure a stable economy. In addition, the results can be used in the development of banking policy and regulation of banking institutions, which will help to strengthen financial stability and economic development of the country.
## Purpose
The purpose of this study is to analyze, evaluate and forecast the reliability of commercial banks based on economic and mathematical modeling.
## Tasks
To achieve this goal, the following tasks were set:
1. To analyze the banking sector of Ukraine and identify the factors that
that affect the reliability of banks.
2. To analyze the performance of 67 Ukrainian banks of various forms of ownership
for the period from January 1, 2018 to January 1, 2023.
3. Conduct a cluster analysis based on the results of 2021 and 2022 to
to classify the objects, including in times of war.
4. Develop a set of econometric models to analyze the reliability of individual banks.
of individual banks.
5. Conduct a comparative analysis of the developed models and use the best
the best one to forecast the reliability of banks.
6. To draw conclusions and suggestions for the further functioning of individual banks.
of individual banks.
## Data
To accomplish these tasks, the financial indicators of 67 Ukrainian banks operating as of January 1, 2023 for the period from 01.01.2018 to 01.01.2023
## Results
In analyzing the banking system of Ukraine and considering methods of assessing reliability of Ukrainian banks, it was concluded that the reliability of banks should be assessed based on the following indicators: absolute liquidity ratio capital adequacy, deposit to loan ratio, return on assets, return on equity, and coverage ratio. In turn, they are components of the for rating the reliability of banks.

The charts of bank reliability show that since the beginning of the war, these ratios began to fall for many banks, but by the beginning of January 2023, almost all banks almost all banks began to return to normal levels, increasing their their reliability ratios. It should also be noted that even with the outbreak of war, the level of banks' reliability did not fall to critical levels.

Over the entire period under study, abnormally high values of banks' reliability that need to be investigated in more detail. It was found that banks with state-owned banks follow a normal distribution law, while for private and foreign banks there are a large number of outliers (very
large rating values). The most prominent representatives of this group are JSC BANK AVANGARD and JSC BTA BANK, which in recent years have been receiving rating values from 58 to 233, while the maximum normal value was 7. That is why in the future, special attention should be paid to the study of these banks and to identify the causes of abnormal values.

We also found a strong correlation between the rating indicator and the ratio of deposits to loans. This fact explains the abnormally high values of the ratings, as this indicator influenced them. We also found the relationship between capital adequacy and the coverage ratio and the return on assets and return on equity.

According to the rating, the leader of state-owned banks in 2021 was JSC CB
“PrivatBank with a rating of 7.08, and in 2022 - JSC Oschadbank with a rating of 4.14. In 2022, PrivatBank was assigned to an abnormal group of clusters due to its high reliability value, and therefore its place was taken by Oschadbank with with a much lower rating. Private banks proved to be the most stable after the outbreak of hostilities. It is noticeable that in 2021 and 2022, the leader was JSC “BANK PORTAL, which even increased its rating. Also. the worst of the private banks, JSCB Lviv, also ranks last based on the results of two years, but after the outbreak of war, the rating also increased after the war. Among the banks with a state share and foreign capital it is noticeable that since the beginning of the war, the rating value has decreased by almost half, which indicates a significant impact of military operations on the reliability of banks.

As a result of clustering in 2021 and 2022, banks were divided into 3 groups: least reliable, medium reliable, and most reliable. According to all tests, it was found that in 2022, the clustering of banks was more and the division into groups was more logical. Also, in 2022, many banks found themselves with negative ROA and ROE and suffered losses. In general, the clustering results showed that banks with high reliability changed the average value of reliability from 5.51 to 5.85, with the average - from 3.89 to 3.76, and low reliability banks - from 3.03 to 2.36. That is, reliable banks have become even more reliable reliable, those with an average level of reliability did not change their value, and banks with a low rating received an average rating value almost 1 point lower. The results of the 2022 clustering also revealed that the group of banks with low reliability was affected by the hostilities in Ukraine
the most. Therefore, these banks should be paid attention to, because in the near future they may find it difficult to withstand the existing risks and crises and may likely face liquidation. These banks include: JSC Ukrsimbank, JSC BANK FORWARD, JSC Sens Bank and others. And the banks in the high reliability cluster reliability, really have high values of financial indicators compared to compared to the others. Therefore, it can be said that these banks have withstood the war and will most likely will remain on the market. Among them: JSC CB PrivatBank, JSC Concorde Bank, “JSC IIB, JSC Altbank and others.

In general, ARIMA modeling proved to be the best for predicting the reliability rating in terms of forecast accuracy. According to the forecasts, it was found that the rating of JSCB “Lviv”
will start to grow very slowly, so it may not be an outsider in the future
among the banks and is unlikely to be liquidated, but it will not be included in the group with medium reliability group in the coming years. In turn, the rating of JSC “Raiffeisen Bank's rating will decline significantly by April 2024, which may result in the bank's enter the group of banks with low reliability, but by 2025 it will begin to stabilize again to stabilize and return to an average level of reliability. Ratings of JSC CB “PrivatBank” according to the forecasts will be at a high level, compared to its reliability value until April 2022. Therefore we can conclude that with the outbreak of hostilities, its rating has only started to grow and will continue to be at a fairly high level.
